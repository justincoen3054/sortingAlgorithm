Sorting 10k numbers using the Comb Sort

The program uses a sort called the Comb Sort which is essentially
a modified Bubble Sort but instead of checking elements of the 
array that are next to each other, there is a large gap in b/w. The
gap becomes smaller with each pass until it becomes 1 as in the bubble sort.

The Comb Sort finishes the sorting in 38 passes of the array.
